                    <p>Nonny volunteered at food pantries, and brought necessities to members of her church in the projects. She would also drive her elderly church members around and bring them to church and church events. She also had special permission to bring communion to a blind member of her church who couldn't attend regularly. </p>

                    <p>"All the workers at Fontano's [the sandwich shop Barbara and Jim owned], felt like a part of the family at Fontano's. The employees, not a part of her family in any way, still called Barabara "Nonny" and loved working for her and Jim. 
                        They were always accommodating and kind to their employees and everyone there, customer and employee alike, were treated with the same kindness a close family member would be" <br> - Claire Sherman

                <div class="content">
                    <p>"Years ago Mom would host a gathering, and she called it "The New Harmonium". They invited their friends to what amounted to a talent show where everyone could showcase their talents. Mom always accompanied anyone who needed an accompanist, especially dad who usually sang "If I Were a Rich Man". Towards the end of the evening dad would say, "goodnight I'm going to bed" and left mom to entertain the late nighters. Never complaining, always kind and gracious". <br>   - Missy</p>
